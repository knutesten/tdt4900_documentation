\chapter{Focus group 2}

\section{Procedure}

\subsection{Participants}
Participants from the previous focus group session, but due to conflicts in schedule only 4 out of the 5 could make it. For this session there were three females and one male present. The ages were between 34 - 36.

\subsection{Location and procedure}
The focus group was conducted at St. Olav's Hospital but we were unable to obtain the exact same room.  This mattered little because the room we did acquire had the all the necessary equipment. Much like the first session the participants were seated around a table facing a projector canvas. The visualizations were controlled by the assistant moderator, a laptop was provided for the participants at the end where they could shift through visualizations and colours, and discuss them in pairs of two. The entire session was once again video recorded and transcribed.

\subsection{Plan}
There were 3 main topics to be discussed during the focus group, the outline with explanations can be found below. The session ended with a summary and feedback on the focus group itself.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Present the scenarios that the moderators had interpreted from last focus group.
  \item Let the participants validate, discuss and review the scenarios in written form.
  \item Present the revised visualizations while, and receive feedback on each before moving on to the next.
  \item Present the requirements created based on the feedback received in the previous focus group.
  \item Perform a group discussion and revision on the requirements.
  \item Perform an informal interview where the participants explain in detail how physiotherapy is practised by them.
  
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}

To get an overview of how physiotherapy is conducted in Norway we performed an interview on the participants of the focus group. The physiotherapists that were recruited for the focus groups work with elderly and patients that otherwise needs to be helped from home (e.g. patients suffering from Cerebral Palsy). The seven step process below describes what happens when a patient is referred to a physiotherapist:

\vspace{-4mm}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A general practitioner or other healthcare personnel can fill out an application for their patients to see a physiotherapist.
  \item The application is then evaluated and placed into a priority queue. Applications may be prioritized if the matter is time sensitive, such as recovery after a fracture or surgery.
  \item When a physiotherapist is available they are given the application on top of the priority queue.
  \item The physiotherapist then makes a house visit to the patient so that they may get an understanding of the current activity level. The activity level is mapped through several different types of exercises and through conversations with the patient. Overall posture and the speed of movements help assess the general state of the patient.
  \item The next step is to create an exercise plan for the patient in order to increase the activity level. During conversations with the patient the physiotherapist discusses what kind of improvements are realistic to achieve considering the current activity level, motivation, physical health etc. All of this data is then used to create an exercise plan that the patient can follow to reach their goals.
  \item When an appropriate plan has been created the physiotherapist returns to the patient to explain how the exercises are executed as well as motivating the patient to reach his goals. The plan may also include other types of activity, for many patients something as simple as walking to the store to buy groceries can be enough to make a difference in the overall activity.
  \item Physiotherapist will return regularly to check up on the patient. The interval between check-ups will vary in respect to how well the physiotherapists expects the patient to follow the agreed upon plan. Some patients lack motivation, and will need more regular check-ups. During such meetings the physiotherapist will get an idea of how much the patient has improved, emphasizing the improvement made is an important factor in motivating the patient to abide to the plan. If there has been little or no change in the activity level, the physiotherapist may want to make changes to the plan so better results are achieved.
