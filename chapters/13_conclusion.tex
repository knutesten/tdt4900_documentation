%\item[Research Question 2:] What are the functional and user experience requirements for visualizations of \gls{imu} data in scenarios identified by the physiotherapists?

\section{RQ2: Requirements}
The requirements have had several iterations through the project. It started with the initial requirements outlined in chapter~\ref{ch:initialRequirements} which were iterated upon in focus groups 1 (chapter \ref{ch:focusGroup1}). In addition a set of \gls{ux} requirements were outline after focus group 1. Table~\ref{tab:f2ReqCon} and~\ref{tab:f2ReqUxCon} display what we consider to be the final functional and \gls{ux} requirements for visualizations of data identified by the physiotherapists.
\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|p{12cm}|}
    \hline
      \textbf{Id} & \textbf{Requirement} \\ \hline
    \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{The visualizations should \ldots} \\ \hline
      F2-1 & give the user an overview of the week where the days are classified by national recommendations or personal goals \\ \hline
      F2-2 & show the activity level for each hour of the day \\ \hline
      F2-3 & make it easy to identify the length of activity intervals \\ \hline
      F2-4 & make it possible to compare multiple days \\ \hline
      F2-5 & make it easy to identify hours of the day where activity can be added \\ \hline
      F2-6 & show the activity level compared to national or personal goals \\ \hline
      F2-7 & let the user identify patients that are active during the night \\ \hline
      F2-8 & let you compare two separate weeks to see the patients progress \\ \hline
      F2-9 & should be printable in grayscale \\ \hline
      F2-10 & show the activity distribution for a day (sedentary, standing, walking) \\ \hline
      F2-11 & allow the users to toggle if nighttime should be included or not \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}

Both functional and UX requirements presented here should be used as a basis for creating visualizations in physiotherapy. We assume that these requirements will be expanded upon when developing a system for a specific customer and purpose.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|p{12cm}|}
    \hline
      \textbf{Id} & \textbf{Requirement} \\ \hline
    \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{The visualizations should \ldots} \\ \hline
      F2-11 & not be judgemental towards the patients activity level \\ \hline
      F2-12 & should be honest about the patients activity level \\ \hline
      F2-13 & should motivate the patient to be more active \\ \hline
      F2-14 & should be intuitive and easy to understand for the user and third parties \\ \hline
      F2-15 & be easy to explain to cognitively capable patients \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
