We want to thank our supervisor Professor Dag Svan√¶s (aka. Svanen) for guiding us through the process of creating this master thesis. We also wish to extend gratitude to domain expert at St. Olav's Hospital and the physiotherapists who participated in the two focus groups. Without their knowledge and insight this project would not be possible. Lastly we want to thank Darth Vader, who has been an inspiration to us and all other nerds since 1977.
