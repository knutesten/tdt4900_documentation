\noindent
This master thesis is the final part required for us to attain a Master of Science degree at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The work in this thesis was conducted from the start of February to the end of June 2013 at The Department of Computer and Information Science (IDI).

We would like to thank our supervisor Professor Dag Svan√¶s for guiding us through the process of creating this master thesis. We also wish to extend gratitude to domain expert at St. Olav's Hospital and the physiotherapists who participated in the two focus groups. Without their knowledge and insight this project would not be possible. Lastly we want to thank Darth Vader, who has been a continuing source of inspiration throughout the project.
