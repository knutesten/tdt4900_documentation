\noindent
This master thesis is the final part required for us to attain a Master of Science degree at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The work in this thesis was conducted from the start of February to the end of June 2013 at the Department of Computer and Information Science (IDI).

\noindent
We would like to thank our supervisor Professor Dag Svan√¶s for the invaluable guidance we have received during our work. We also wish to extend gratitude to the domain expert at St. Olav's Hospital and the physiotherapists who participated in the two focus groups. Without their knowledge and insight this project would not have been possible.
