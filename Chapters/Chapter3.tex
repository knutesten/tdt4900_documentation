A movement known as Quantified Self*\cite{quantifiedSelf} who had their first conference in 2011\cite{bodyHackers}, is interested in gaining more self knowledge through self-tracking. This goes far beyond simply tracking physical activity, they wish to quantify as much data as possible such as mood, sleep patterns and diet. The exchange of information within the movement between users and tool makers allows for new, exciting and relevant technology to be developed. The FuelBand\cite{fuelBand}, Fitbit\cite{fitBit} are some of results of this cooperation, and both products seem to be well received by the movement. %ADD CITATION, ARTICLE NOT DONE YET.
