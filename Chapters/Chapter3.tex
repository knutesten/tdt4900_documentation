A movement known as Quantified Self*\cite{quantifiedSelf} who had their first conference in 2011\cite{bodyHackers}, is interested in gaining more self knowledge through self-tracking. This goes far beyond simply tracking physical activity, they wish to quantify as much data as possible such as mood, sleep patterns, and diet. The exchange of information within the movement between users and tool makers allows for new, exciting and relevant technology to be developed. The FuelBand\cite{fuelBand}, Fitbit\cite{fitBit} are some of results of this cooperation, and both products seem to be well received by the movement. %ADD CITATION, ARTICLE NOT DONE YET.

\subsection{Wrist worn activity monitors}
The Nike+ Fuelband\cite{fuelBand} was the first wrist worn activity monitor to be released. The wristband contains a 3-axis accelerometer that tracks the users wrist movement, and activity is converted to \emph{Nikefuel}. Nikefuel\cite{nikefuel} is a unit of measurment used by all Nike activity trackers, however there are no details on how activity is converted to Nikefuel as the algorithm is proprietary. The wristband does calculate steps and calories burned, but the Nikefuel is the prime focus of their productline. Nikefuel does not take into account gender, height, weight but looks purely at activity. Meaning that a mile will award the same amount of points to users of very different physiology.

The information from the fuelband can be uploaded to an iPhone or laptop which then send the information to the Nike+ servers and update the users profile. The online profile provides detailed information of the users activity. Showing steps, calories burned, active time, distance traveled and average fuel. Charts can be displayed for weeks, months or years. This allows the user to track their progress and look at how often they achieve or go way above their goals.\cite{fuelbandTechSpce} 

Virtual trophies are awarded for various achievements such as gathering an X amount of NikeFuel or beating your set goal by a 100\%. These trophies can then be shared with friends or displayed on the public profile to show off your achievements. The band itself can be used to view simple information such as how far you are from your daily goal, steps taken, and calories burned. A review has reported that the NikeFuel concept can almost become an addiction and lead to doing some last minute workouts the goal in order to achieve that satisfying sensation \cite{fuelbandDcRain}

%Unsure if specific technical details should be mentioned, such as that it communicates through bluetooth etc. I figure the relevancy of these products is more on how they do things and what we can learn.
