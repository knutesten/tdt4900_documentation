\section{Purpose/Motivation}
The elderly population is in a constant rise, currently 15\% of the norwegian population is above the age of 65. By the turn of the century the elderly population is expected to double \cite{elder}. The initial rise of the elder population will be most noticable in those below the age of 80, as seen in figure \ref{fig:elderPopulation}.
%kan man bruke "we will get" her?
 Whereas we will see a great spike in the above 80 population after 2025. 
 %Which publication?
 The publication reports that two out of three above the age of 75 consider themselves having "good health" but only a third preserve this level of health until death.

%Say who it was conducted by and the name of the project
One of the largest ever systematic efforts to describe the global health situation was conducted in 2010. One of their many findings was that since 1970 men and women have gained an additional ten years to their life expectancy, but spend more time living with injuries and illness \cite{globalBurden}. %KOMMER TILBAKE HIT

In the late 1990s the Norwegian statistical bureau published a paper predicting a major increase in the elderly population. The working population compared to the retired currently holds a ratio of 5 to 1. 
%You cant say that it will drop when 1/3 is a larger fraction
This is expected to drop below 3 by the year 2040. Because of this the greatest challenges within wellfare are expected to occur between 1998 and 2020 \cite{eldreEksplosjon}. 

With such predictions the Norwegian government formed a committee (refered to as Hagen-utvalget*) that would investigate the current situation and look at possible solutions \cite{haagen}. 
%I wouldn't say solutions, it's not like they are solving the problem just finding ways to handle it i guess.
One of the conclusions in the report was that too little of today's technology is incorporated as welfare technology* for the elderly.
%maybe mention that it was refered to in the hagen-utvalget report?
%Specify what tasks you mean
A Danish report states that around 20\% of the tasks could be completely or partly replaced by technology \cite{kmd}. 
%I would rewrite this sentence
If the Norwegian circumstances are similar this could lead to great savings in the health budget.

To handle the rising precentage of elerdly people, Hagen-utvalget suggest a national three step program that focus on using welfare technology to diminish falls, social isolation and cognitive failure. Thus improving the overall quality of life for the elder population as well as reducing the workload for health care personel. 
%The step of most relevance to our work is step 3:
Step 3 states that:
%Maybe use quote environment here instead of this strange formating?
